<h3>Future Projects</h3>

	<dt>National Standards for TGIQ Health (Early 2017):</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			Based on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services CLAS standards
			(National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate
			Services in Health and Health Care) and adapted for our communities,
			these will establish community-driven best practices and 
			competencies for providers to meet.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>RAD Certified</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			We will have providers of various sorts provide evidence of continuing
			education they've completed  on topics related to our community,
			and in turn, we provide a special badge for them on the database
			and optimized search results for you.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Provider Competency Project</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			We will assemble an independent, nationwide training database
			mapping trainings to competencies, creating a learning structure
			for providers and identifying gaps in existing training.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Translation Project</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			We will have the site, database, and materials translated into
			as many languages as possible.
		</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Expansion to Additional Countries</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			We hope to expand into other countries through collaboration with 
			local organizations and adaptation of the RAD model as needed
			to better serve systems of health outside the US.
